# Dream-11-using-Pandas-and-Web-scaraping
Here I have used web scraping to get the scorecard of match from ESPN cricinfo. And used Pandas to manipulate the data the way I required. This is the program similar to Dream11.
You can choose your Team XI and captain & vice captain of your team. As you know the Captain and Vice-captain will get awarded by 2x and 1.5x points respectively. Point awarding is much more similar to the Dream11. 8 points for scoring half-century and 16 points for a century. 3 points for every boundry scored whereas 6 points for every Six!!!

You can create Team dataset with the help of web scraping. Here I have attached 2 teams' CSV files.
